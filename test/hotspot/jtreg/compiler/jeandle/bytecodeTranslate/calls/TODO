All the tests in this directory are written based on those in test/hotspot/jtreg/compiler/calls/.
Tests for method calls should include parameters of various types. However, Jeandle's type support is currently incomplete.
Comprehensive testing of different parameter types should be conducted after Jeandle's type support is fully implemented.
